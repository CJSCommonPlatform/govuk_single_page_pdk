## What is the PDK
The PDK is a platform used to make single page applications that deliver government services. It consists of two parts, the feature rich “platform components” and the “platform templates” they contain extendable JavaScript modules and a library of styles respectively. The components and templates provide a complete solution to create business and citizen facing services that are; scalable, intuitive, accessibility compliant and provide a robust user experience. The following principles are the driving force behind the PDK; User Driven Experience, Domain Driven Design, Extendable Governance, Automated Assurance, Continuous Improvement and Openness.
