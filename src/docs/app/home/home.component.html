<h2 class="heading-large" id="pdk-what">What is the PDK?</h2>
<div class="text">
  <p>
    The PDK is a platform used to make single page applications that deliver government services. It consists of two parts, the feature rich “platform components” and the “platform templates” they contain extendable JavaScript modules and a library of styles respectively. The components and templates provide a complete solution to create business and citizen facing services that are; scalable, intuitive, accessibility compliant and provide a robust user experience. The following principles are the driving force behind the PDK; User Driven Experience, Domain Driven Design, Extendable Governance, Automated Assurance, Continuous Improvement and Openness.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    The functionality and esthetics of the platform are based on Government Digital Services (GDS), who are leading the digital transformation of the UK government. GDS guidelines are used as a blueprint to create each individual element inside the platform, ensuring the final product is consistent and compliments the wider digital transformation. Modern technological solutions have been used to enforce usability and underline capabilities of the PDK.

    Why we created this development kit and the principles it was founded on.

      <span class="summary bold-small">User driven experience</span>
    </summary>
    <div class="panel panel-border-narrow">
      <p>
        Providing a good experience for the end user is a priority and is evident throughout the PDK. A user centric approach is demonstrated by the initial efforts of solution designers and user experience (UX) experts guided by valuable user research. This platform has been developed in partnership with design, UX and research teams which has resulted in a user friendly final product. The platform is flexible and can be used to develop business and citizen facing services. Furthermore a tailored user experience can be developed to meet the expectations of various end users especially those accustomed to the GDS guidelines.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>The development team have utilised technological solutions to ensure that the PDK is accessible for all types of users including those that are visually impaired. To solve this challenge the platform facilitates the development of Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA). It’s robust UX capabilities are demonstrated further by multiple platform availability and accessibility across a range of devices via an adaptive responsive layout. So development teams can be assured their services are developed with an optimum user driven experience.</p>

      <span class="summary bold-small">Domain driven design</span>
    </summary>
    <div class="panel panel-border-narrow">
      <p>
        It is beneficial to adopt a well structured approach when developing complex software. The PDK adheres to Domain Driven Design (DDD) principles. This is demonstrated in the components section which provides a set of elements organised by domain. One crucial benefit is the creation of a ubiquitous language understood by domain experts, technical teams, solution designers and user experience teams. The later helps promote consolidation and frequent merging of ideas and code sources, reduces the rate of fragmentation during the product lifecycle.

      <span class="summary bold-small">Extendable governance</span>
    </summary>
    <div class="panel panel-border-narrow">
      <p>
        To maintain consistency across services it is crucial to have generic reusable, styles, features and components that remain extendable.

    <summary>
      <span class="summary bold-small">Automated assurance</span>
    </summary>
    <div class="panel panel-border-narrow">
      <p>
        The PDK contains a suite of automated unit tests and end to end tests validating the front-end data model and user interface. This guarantees a high test coverage of services using the kit as a core library. Each feature must have passing tests before being deployed to a server where Jenkins runs continuous integration tests.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>Automated assurance is one of the main benefits of using the PDK. The technical team conducted a test driven development approach. The positive impact of this reaches quality analysts and end users who have a consistent and positive user experience. It is vital that service users are comfortable and have confidence regarding their expectations.</p>

    </summary>
    <div class="panel panel-border-narrow">
      <p>
        The developers of the PDK follow agile principles and continuously push to make improvements. This is demonstrated by the use of code review tools such as gerrit.
